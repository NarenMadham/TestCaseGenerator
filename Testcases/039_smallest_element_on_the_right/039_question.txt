Problem Name:
Smallest element to the left

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n. Find the closest element that is smaller that the element towards it's left. If there's no such element present, print -1. 

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line is the size of the array. The following line is the n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print the array of n space separated integers where each element is the closes smaller element to it's left.
