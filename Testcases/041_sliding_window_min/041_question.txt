Problem Name:
Sliding window minimum

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n and an integer k. Print the minimum in every subarray k.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 2e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line are 2 space separated integers n and k. The following line are the n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print the minimum of every subarray of size k
