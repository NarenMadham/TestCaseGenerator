Problem Name:
Largest Histogram Area

Problem Statement:
A histogram is a diagram formed by placing all the bars of some height next to each other. All these bars for rectangles of some specific area.
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n where each integer represents the size of the bar in the histogram. Find the maximum area of the histogram formed by these bars in the histogram.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line is a single integer which represents the size of the array. The following line is the array of n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print a single integer which is the value of the maximum area of the rectangle formed by those bars of the histogram.
