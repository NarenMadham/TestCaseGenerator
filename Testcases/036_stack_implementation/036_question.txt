Problem Name:
Stack Implementation

Problem Statement:
You will be given n testcases. Each of the testcase has 3 types of the queries. For the first type (1), push the element (b) into the stack. For the second type(2), print the top element of the stack. For the third type (3), pop the top element from the stack. In either of the cases of 2 and 3, if the stack is empty, simply print "Empty".

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e6
1 <= a <= 3
1 <= b <= 1e6

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by t lines. In each testcase, there are 2 space separate integers a and b. a is the type of the query and b is the second element.

Output Format:
Self Explainatory.
