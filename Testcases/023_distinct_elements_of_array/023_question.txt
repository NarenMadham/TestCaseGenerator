Problem Name:
Distinct elements in a window

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n and an integer k. You have to print the distinct elements in each sub-array of size k of the array.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n, k <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. The first line of the testcase is the size of the array and the integer k. The second line of the testcase are the n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print the distinct elements in each window of size k. The output of each testcase should be printed in each line.
