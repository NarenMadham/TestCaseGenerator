Problem Name:
Workshop Machines

Problem Statement:
There is a workshop where there are 2 machines. These machines might take different cost to perform a task i. All these tasks are continous i.e. you have to solve the ith task and then move to i+1 task. You can shift from one machine to another but it comes with a cost k. 
For every testcase, you will be given 2 integer arrays of length n and a integer cost k. Find the minimum cost required to complete all the tasks.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i], br[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 3t lines. In each testcase, the first line has 2 space separated integers n and k. The following line n space separted integers which are the costs for the first machine. The next line also has n space separted integers which are the costs of B machine.

Output Format:
Print the minimum cost required to complete all the tasks by the two machines.
