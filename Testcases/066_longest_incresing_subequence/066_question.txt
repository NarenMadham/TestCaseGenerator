Problem Name:
Longest Increasing Subsequence

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n. You have to print the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence of the array. 

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line is a single integer which is the size of teh array> the following line has n spae separated integers.

Output Format:
Print a single integer whih is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
