Problem Name:
Array rotation

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n and an integer k. Rotate the array by k times clockwise and print the result.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In Each testcase, the first line has 2 space separated integers n and k. The following line has n space separated integers i.e. the elements of the array. 

Output Format:
Rotate the array by k times clockwise and print all the elements of the array.
