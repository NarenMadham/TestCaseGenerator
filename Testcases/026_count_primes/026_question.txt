Problem Name:
Count Primes

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given a value of n. Find all the primes that are less than or equal to the given n

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e6
1 <= n <= 1e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by t lines. Each testcase has a single integer n

Output Format:
Print a single integer i.e. the count of the primes less thatn or equal to the given number
