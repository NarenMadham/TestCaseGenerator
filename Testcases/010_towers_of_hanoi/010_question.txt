Problem Name:
Towers of Hanoi

Problem Statement:
There are 3 towers A, B and C. All the discs are initially on the tower A, arranged in such a way that biggest disk is on the bottom and the smallest on the top. Shift all the discs from A to C such that a bigger disc cannot be placed on a smaller disc on any tower because the disk might break. Shift all the discs from A to C where B can be used as a helper tower

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 10
1 <= n <= 10

Input Format:
The first line consists of an integer which denotes the number of testcases. Each testcase has a single line which is the number of discs initially on the tower A

Output Format:
Print all the moves involved in moving all the discs from tower A to tower C line after line
