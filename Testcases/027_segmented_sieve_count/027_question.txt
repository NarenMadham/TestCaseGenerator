Problem Name:
Segmented Sieve

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given a pair of integers. Print the count of number of primes present in between the given 2 integers (inclusive of those 2 numbers).

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= a < b <= 1e12
1 <= (b-a) <= 1e6

The sum of lengths of all the differences will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by t lines. Each testcase has a pair of space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print the count of the primes present in between the given pair of integers.
