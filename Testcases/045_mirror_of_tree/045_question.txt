Problem Name:
Mirror of a tree

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n. Construct a Binary search tree with the given array of elements. Modify the tree in a way that it looks like in a mirror. Print the inorder traversal of the mirrored tree.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line is a single integer. The following line has n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print an array of n integers which is the inorder traversal of the mirrored tree.
