Problem Name:
Non Repeating Number

Problem Statement:
For each testcase, You will be given a series of n integers. The series has each element repeated twice except for one element. Find the element that is not repeating. 

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of t i.e. the number of testcases. For each testcase, the first line consists of n which is the size of the series and the following consists of a series of n integers.

Output Format:
Print a single integer that is non-repeating in each series
