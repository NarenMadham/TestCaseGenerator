Problem Name:
Longest Subarray with equal 0 and 1

Problem Statement:
In Every testcase, you will be given a binary array of size n. Find the longest length of the subarray with equals number of 0s and 1s in the array.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. The first line has a single integer which is the size of the array. The following line has n space separated integers either 0 or 1

Output Format:
Print a single integer which ids the length of the longest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s
