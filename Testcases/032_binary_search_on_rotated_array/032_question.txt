Problem Name:
Binary Search on rotated array

Problem Statement:
In every testcase, You will be given an array of integers and an integer k. The array of integers is a sorted array which is rotated. Print the index at which the element k is present in the array. Every array will definitely have the element k in it.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e6
1 <= ar[i] < 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line has the size of the array and the integer k. The following line has the n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print the index at which the element k is present. Follow 1-based indexing.
