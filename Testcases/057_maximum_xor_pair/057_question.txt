Problem Name:
Maximum XOR Pair

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an integer array of size n. You have to print the maximum value of the XOR formed by any pair of the array.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line has a single integer n. The following line has 

Output Format:
Print a single integer that is the maximum xor value of any pair of the array.
