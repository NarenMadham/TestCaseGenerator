Problem Name:
Smallest k elements

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n and an integer k. You will have to print the smallest k elements among the given n integers of the array.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line has 2 space separated integers. The size of the array and the value of k. The following line has n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print k space separated integers which are the smallest k elements of all the integers.
