Problem Name:
Level Order Traversal

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers. Construct a binary search tree of all the elements and print the elements in each level line by line.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line is a single integer which is the size of the array. The following line has n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print the level orde traversal line by line.
