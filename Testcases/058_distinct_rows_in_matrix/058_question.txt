Problem Name:
Distinct rows in a matrix

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given a binary matrix of size n x m. You have to count the distinct rows of a matrix and print the count as the result.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e2
1 <= n,m <= 1e2
0 <= ar[i] <= 1

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t. In each testcase, the first line has 2 space separated integers n and m. The following n lines are binary strings 

Output Format:
Print the single integer as the output.
