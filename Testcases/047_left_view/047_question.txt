Problem Name:
Left view of the tree

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n. Construct a Binary Search Tree with all the elements of the array. Print all the nodes that you can see in a tree when viewed from the left side of the tree in an order of top to bottom

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line is a single integer n. The following line has n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print the left view of the tree.
