Problem Name:
Inversion Count

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given a series of integers. Find the number of pairs such that i < j and ar[i] > ar[j] (inversion). Count the number of inversion of the given array.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e6
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9


Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t. Each testcase has 2 lines. The first line is the size of the array n. The second line comprises of n space separated integers. 

Output Format:
Print a single integer which denotes the count of inversions in the given array
