Problem Name:
Tree Traversals

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n. You have to create a Binary Search Tree of all those elements. Print the preorder, inorder and postorder traversals of all the trees generated

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line has a single integer which is the size of the array. The following line has n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print 3 arrays of size n. The first being the preorder, next being inorder and the last being postorder.
