Problem Name:
Height of a tree

Problem Statement:
The height of a tree is the edge length from the root of the tree to the deepest node of the tree. For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers. Construct a Binary search tree of all those elements and pring the height of the tree.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, ths first line is a single integer and the following line has n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print a single integer which is the height of the entire tree.
