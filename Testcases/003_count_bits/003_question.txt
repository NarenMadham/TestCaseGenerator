Problem Name:
Count number of bits

Problem Statement:
For all the testcases (t), you will be given a number (n). Find the number of set bits in the binary representation of the given number.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e6
1 <= n <= 1e9

Input Format:
The first line represents the number of testcases(t) followed by t lines. Each line is a testcase that has a single integer.

Output Format:
Print the count of number of setbits in the binary representation of each integer.
