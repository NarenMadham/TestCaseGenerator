Problem Name:
Maximum non adjacent sum

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n. Find the subsequence witht the maximum sum such that the adjacent elements are not allowed in the subarray.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e6
-1e9 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by t lines. In each testcase, the first line is a single integer. The following line has n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Print a single integer which is the maximum non adjacent sum.
