Problem Name:
Sum of Xors


Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be gicen an array of integers. Find the sum of xor of all the pairs of the array.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1000
1 <= n <= 1e6
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all elements of the array will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of a single number which is the number of testcases. For each testcase, the first line denotes the size of the array n. Following line has n space separated integers


Output Format:
Print a single integer which is the sum of xor of all the pairs of the integer
