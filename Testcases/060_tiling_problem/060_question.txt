Problem Name:
Tiling Problem

Problem Statement:
You are given a floor of surface n x 5 units. The height of the surface is fixed. The width varies with every testcase. You will having infinite supply of 1 x n tiles in 2 colors, black or white. You can place a tile either horizontally or vertically. The entire surface of the floor should be covered.

For every testcase, you will be given the size of the surface. Print the number of ways to print the entire surface area. 

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e6
1 <= n <= 1e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by t lines. In each testcase, you will be given a single integer which is the size of the floor.

Output Format:
Print a single integer as the output which is the number of ways. Since, the value may be more, print the output as % (1e9 + 7)
