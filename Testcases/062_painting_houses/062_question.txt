Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e3
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 4t lines. In each testcase, The first line is the size of the array. The second, third and fourth lines have n space separated integers.
