Problem Name:
Add Numbers to the subarray

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an integer n and q queries. For every testcase, there is a number 'x', and two indexes 'a' and 'b'. 

Consider an array of size n with every element as 0. For each query, add x from indexes a through b. Print the array after performing all the q queries.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e6
1 <= n <= 1e6
0 <= a,b < n

Input Format:
The first line consists of the size of the array n and the number of queries followed by q lines. Each testcase has 3 space separated integers. The number to be added, and the two indexes.  

Output Format:
Print the array of n elements after performing the q queries.
