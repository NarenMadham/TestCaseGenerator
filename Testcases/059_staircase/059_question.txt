Problem Name:
Staircase Problem

Problem Statement:
A man is trying to get on a staircase. The man can climb either one step or two steps at a time. 
For every testcase, you will be given the length of the staircase. You have to print the number of different ways to reach the top of the staircase. 

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e6
1 <= n <= 1e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by t lines. Each testcase has a single integer i.e. the length of the staircase.

Output Format:
Print the single integer as the output which is the number of ways to climb the staircase. Since the answer is large, print % 1e9 + 7
