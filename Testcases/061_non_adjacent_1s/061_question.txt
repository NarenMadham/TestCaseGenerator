Problem Name:
Non Adjacent set bits

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given a length of the string in. The string is going to have only binary numbers. You have to find the number of strings such that there are not more than 2 adjacent set bits. 

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e6
1 <= n <= 1e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by t lines. In each testcase, there is a single integer which is the length of the string.

Output Format:
Print a singel integer which is the number of possible strings.
